                provided to use the Platform or to make full use of the functionality of
                the Application. Should you choose not to provide information, this could

                (and related activities) for which you have shared the information with
                Us. We will disclose the minimum PII necessary to accomplish these purposes.
                We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and
                individuals outside of BlueJay unless one of the following circumstances
                applies:

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>With Your consent</b>
                    <br>We will share PII with companies, organizations or individuals outside
                    of BlueJay when We have Your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent

                  <li>
                    <b>For external processing or services</b>
                    <br>We provide PII to Our affiliates or other trusted business partners or
                    persons to process it for Us or provide services. These third-parties can

                    Privacy Statement and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
                    measures.</li>
                  <li>

                    <br>We will share PII with companies, organizations or individuals outside
                    of BlueJay if We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation
                    or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to (i) meet any
                    applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
                    (ii) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential
                    violations; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security
                    or technical issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property
                    or safety of BlueJay, its users or the public as required or permitted
                    by law.
                    <br>All of Your PII maintained by Us, including information you provide on
                    the Websites and the App, is also subject to the Notices of Privacy Practices
                    issued by Us under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
                    Act (“HIPAA”). The Notices of Privacy Practices may contain additional
                    provisions relating to the use and disclosure of Your information that
                    go beyond the terms of this Privacy Statement.</li>

                    <b>Other requests to limit sharing of PII</b>
                    <br>State and federal laws may allow you to request that we limit our uses
                    and disclosures of your personal information for treatment, payment, and
                    health care operations purposes. We will consider all requests and, if
                    we deny your request, we will notify you in writing. Federal law requires
                    us to agree to your request to restrict disclosures to a health plan or
                    insurer relating to specific health care services, if you have paid for
                    those services in full. The law does not, however, require us to restrict
                    any disclosures we think are important for treatment purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly
                and with Our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites.
                For example, We may share non-PII aggregated data and information publicly
                to show trends about the general use of Our services.</footer>

              <footer>Pursuant to applicable regulations, We maintain commercially reasonable
                technical and organizational measures to help protect Your PII against
                accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized
                disclosure or access. We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology
                on Our Platform to help protect your PII. Your user account registration
                information is password-protected and encrypted so that only you and Us
                have access to this PII. Do not divulge Your password to anyone; sharing
                your password with anyone compromises the security of Your PII. Also remember
                to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have
                finished using the Platform, particularly if you share a computer with
                someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or
                Internet cafe.
                <br>
                <br>We restrict access to PII to those of Our employees, contractors and agents
                who need to know that information in order to process it for Us, and who
                are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be
                disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations. Unfortunately,
                no information security system can be 100% secure. As a result, although
                We strive to protect your PII, We cannot ensure or warrant the security
                of your PII against any possible loss or unauthorized access.
                <br>
                <br>We keep PII for as long as We think is necessary or advisable and We reserve
                the right to retain it to the full extent permitted by law. We may discard
                PII in Our discretion, so you should retain your own records, and not solely
                rely upon Our storage of any PII or other data.
                <br>
                <br>In case of any breach in which PII is accessed, We will notify You of
                such breach within a reasonable time and work to minimize the effects of
                the breach as required under applicable law.</footer>

                You visit a site. Cookies are then sent back to the originating site on
                each subsequent visit, or to another site that recognizes that cookie.
                Web beacons, also called "clear GIFs" or "web bugs", are tiny graphics
                with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used
                to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are
                stored on your hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on site pages.
                For the purposes of this Statement, both cookies and web beacons are referred
                to as “cookies”.
                <br>
                <br>Cookies are useful because they allow a site to recognize a user’s device.
                Cookies do a lot of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages
                efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving Your
                user experience. We may employ cookies from third-parties to help Us compile
                aggregated statistics regarding the operations of Our site. We prohibit
                cookies on Our site from being used by third-parties to collect or access
                your PII. When You receive email from Us, We may use cookies, customized
                links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened
                and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications
                or other information, to help Us record metrics to enhance your experience
                on Our Website.
                <br>
                <br>If you do not want to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject
                them. However, if you turn cookies off, you may not have access to some
                of Our Platform’s services and features. Unless you have adjusted your
                browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, Our system will issue cookies
